Create a linked-list that allows:

an add function that takes a value and inserts it into a given position into the list
(example: myList.add(someValue, somePosition) )

a remove function that takes a position and removes the value stored at that position of the list and returns it
(example: myList.remove(somePosition) )

a get function that takes a position and returns that value without removing it
(example: myList.get(somePosition) )

Once you have implemented and tested your code, add to the README file what line(s) of code or inputs and outputs show your work meeting each of the above requirements (or better, include a small screen snip of where it meets the requirement!).

Attempt to analyze the complexity of your implementation with line-by-line analysis,
