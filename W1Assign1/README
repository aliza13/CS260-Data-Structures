A program can respresent a bag of marbles by initializing an empty list. The list represents the bag and each item represents a marble. Each marble can have multiple elements (nested list). With many list methods, you can represent, add, and/or remove marbles. I am basing this off of python since python has methods like pop and append. You can manipulate each element as you choose, including removing a random marble with random function and .remove or pop() methods. Or adding a marble in the middle of the bag. 
To make sure my implementation of a bag of marbles is workings is to write tests. For example, if we use the random function, we need to 
make sure the amount of marbles does not go above the range of the random function. If so, this method would return a message that says
"Cannot perform this feature at the moment. Out of range".

I tried implementing a bag of marble by making a list of items. Next, I try adding and removing marbles and outputting the output but it is not working. cout << is not working.

Need to test my code somehow.

Once you have implemented and tested your code, add to the README file what line(s) of code or inputs and outputs show your work meeting each of the above requirements (or better, include a small screen snip of where it meets the requirement!).
